# Size-Tracking

This mini project will detect the size of an object if we are given a reference object(left-most image) whose dimensions is known. If you know the dimension of the left-most image then this model can approximately detect the dimension of the other objects in the model. The Picture 
has to be taken parallel to the image in order to get accurate results. The assumption is that you place the objects such as coins, small boxes, tablets in a table such that the background is clear and not complicated.
